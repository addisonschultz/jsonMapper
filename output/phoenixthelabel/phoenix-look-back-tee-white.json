Our birth took place in Africa. The cradle of our existence originates from the Horn of Africa. That is our history. The past teaches you more than you initially think. When you know where you come from, you’ll have a better idea of where you’re going to. Without our roots, we are lost. We all originate from Africa, we all have our own story, our own history.
