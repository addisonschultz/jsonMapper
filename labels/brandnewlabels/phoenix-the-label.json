  "description": "PHOENIX is a creative platform based in Amsterdam. PHOENIX stands for positive change through love and creativity.\n\nPHOENIX comes from the mythical animal that could rise from its own ashes. This is what we, as the founders of PHOENIX, stand for: rediscovering and improving ourselves and the world around us.\n\nWith this in mind, we offer a platform for everything and everyone that fits in with this. We want our label to be a collective in which we can inspire each other in the areas of (self) acceptance, growth, creativity and the complex noun 'love'.\nStand for love and development.\nJoin our label.",
