  "description": "ROLÁNN clothing is a Dutch fashion brand which emerged due to the shortage of ‘oversized’ or ‘loose fit’ clothing in the Dutch streetwear scene. Created by Erwin Miedema in 2017 who desired to change this and decided to pursue his goal of creating a fashion brand which could satisfy this demand.\n\nAiming for a fair production process which creates high quality products, ROLÁNN’s pieces are entirely produced in the Netherlands. The garments are hand made by experienced men with a refugee background who are motivated to build a new life in Holland.\n\nInspired by London’s streetstyle Rolann consistently creates and develops innovative fits and designs. They stand for clothing that is accessible for everyone while offering a unique product.",
