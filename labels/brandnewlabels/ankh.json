  "description": "Four highly creatives laid the first bricks for ANKH Streetwear™, each of whom share a simular passion for high-end, contemporary streetwear and for their North-African and Middle Eastern herritage. ANKH™ inherits its name from the ancient Egyptian religion; from which we also incorporated these influences into modern design, establishing both a subliminal and raw character. Bringing all these elements together, we managed to find an alternative path, turning ANKH™ into an authentic creator of high-end, contemporary streetwear garment.\n\nFocusing on creating ready-to-wear apparel, we aspire to bring together the perfect combination of sublime and statement making fashion while safeguarding authenticity with an emphasis on tailoring durable and reliable fabric. We aim to develop fashion which compliments your passion for individuality and uniqueness.\n\n",
