  "description": "“A small ecological label making comfortable and cool clothes for you to wear at any time any day.”\n\nThis sentence says a lot about my brand. ZWAAN is a small label. It’s just me!\n\nI make every single product myself, starting with the design, to making the patterns, sewing, packing ect.. Everything is done in the Netherlands, Zeeland.\nI use sustainable fabrics, mostly GOTS certified cotton, leftovers which I got or sometimes even old clothes. I combine the leftovers and the old clothes and make them into ONE OF A KIND products.\nIn this case you buy something that only you will have! My style is quite timeless and therefore made to last.\"",
