  "description": "Gachot is a small business run by me, Yara, and we are on a bold and ethical textile mission! By ‘we’, I am referring to all the people and hands that help create this brand.\n\nGachot was founded with a deep love for bold beauty, handcraft and all that the earth provides. There are people behind the clothes you wear, the products you use. There is cultivated land, a union of human labour and earthly forces. Creating 'sustainable' products means making something that is good for the environment, good for society and makes some good money for all parties involved. This philosophy is at the core of our supply chain.",
