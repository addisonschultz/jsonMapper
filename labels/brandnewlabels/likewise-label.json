  "description": "An architect from The Hague and a lawyer from Amsterdam. They met through sports, dancing to be more precise, and while neither of them was very good at busting dance moves, their love of sport started a life-long friendship. Both had trouble finding sustainable, high quality, affordable sports clothing.\n\nOver two years ago, Zaal had a bright idea: why not create reversible sports clothing? That way you get four (!) options out of only one sports set, the ideal minimalistic solution. This double-sided sports-set is sustainable produced and executed in ultra soft fabrics, a super comfortable high waist fit and no compromising when it comes to functionality.\n\nThe label is called LikeWiseLabel, Netherlands first fully reversible, sustainable produced sports brand!",
