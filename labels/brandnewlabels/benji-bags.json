  "description": "Everybody knows them: advert banners. Huge ones at festivals, or standing ones during an event. All these banners are thrown away after they have been used. We are BENJI BAGS and we turn these banners into bags. Each bag is produced exclusively out of residual waste. This is why there is just one of each: every BENJI BAG is unique.\nThey are handmade in a social workplace in Delft, the Netherlands. This workplace has their own goal: to let people (re-)integrate in the job market. This is why the workplace works alongside institutes providing daily activity, institutes for people with a disability and they have got multiple internships available. BENJI BAGS thinks sustainable fashion should be available for everyone. "
