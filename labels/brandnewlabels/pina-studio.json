  "description": "Pina Studio is founded in Amsterdam in 2019. We’re a slow fashion concept founded from the shift to provenance and resilience in the industry.\n\nOffering a sustainable alternative to the more readily-available fashion giants, our garments are produced locally, with love and passion from craftsman who’ve worked in the industry for decades and provide living wage. Working only with natural and sustainable textiles, we strive for a low-impact supply chain by producing in small batches and with a seasonless calendar.\n\nInspired by art, nature and playful silhouettes, we hope to contribute cool, contemporary pieces to your wardrobe that you’ll love for years to come. Jumpsuits: all day, every day.",
