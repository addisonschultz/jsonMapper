  "description": "Inspired by the skate and sneakers scene, outdoor and the environment, we create limited collections of leftover fabrics. These so-called leftover fabrics are fabrics that are seen as waste, by producers, shops or consumers. \n \nFor us, our clothing is a way of trying to tell people a bigger story. We want show that the current valuation of materials we have is no longer what it should be.\n \nWe have created a sustainable supply chain were the term local is leading. We gather our fabrics as much as possible in the region. Our production is done in a local sewing company and details like printing or embroidery is done in our hometown.\n"
