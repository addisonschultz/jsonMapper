  "description": "It is in our understanding that every designed artifact serves a didactic function: we are taught the world in a slightly different way through each and every interaction. With this belief centre to our hearts, we run Sozo Apparel as a design experiment: an absurd what-if scenario in which one company manages to infiltrate every corner of some distant reality.\nThis approach bleeds into all of our workings and forces us to invest great care and focus down to the details in our products. Contra our capitalistic fever dream that is our cornerstone, all of our products are sustainably sourced and produced.\n\nWe’re not in this business to shape overconsuming behaviour. We’re in this business to let you think differently about products, to engage differently with the pieces you wear. This is also why each and every of our products are made from sustainable and ethically produced materials unless specified so. \n\n \n\n"
