It is a non-woven material made out of pineapple fibers in the Philippines. Making Piñatex contributes to increased employment for the locals. Piñatex is a sustainable alternative for leather and so suitable for vegans.\n\nBesides sustainability, craftsmanship and design are important to ANANAS Ams. Our stylish belts are made in the Netherlands on high quality. Each buckle is vintage so every belt is unique. This all takes care that our customers walk out of their house with a happy face.\nJust like the owners of ANANAS Ams do.",
