  "description": "They arenâ€™t just the brightest kid in class, but also easy on the eyes: the RAKE swimming shorts fitted with a 100% waterproof pocket!\n\nRAKE is a brand that has its roots in the Dutch countryside, and has been polished by the city of Amsterdam. We believe in taking the seasonal nature out of swimming wear, by straying away from trendy prints, or yearly collections. Instead, we aim to create timeless designs, that are also crafted to last for years.\n\nPlus, every time one of our shorts manages to save a phone from drowning, it saves up to your bodyweight in CO2.\n",
